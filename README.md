Schedule Script Syntax Highlighting. Its for Schedule Personalizer config files, dont worry about it.

I am lazy so yeah.
## Features

Syntax highlighting for Schedule Personalizer config files. Its doesnt do much other than that at the moment.

## Requirements

It requires that you are using schedule personalizer or the schedule script language.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

* Syntax highlighting is not perfect, but it works. Its good enough to make writing it bareable at the moment.

## Release Notes

* Initial Commit, nothing special.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of schedule script syntax highlighting
